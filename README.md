# Jack-Tools
> A collection of tools from since I started programming in lisp. 

Not all tools are maintained and the vast majority are not documented. I'll get around to it... someday.
The packages /objects, /cli, /withs, /keys, are probably the more interesting ones.

## Installation
```
clone this repository, then:
(ql:quickload :jack-tools)
```

Submodules have been provided, be sure to initialize them and move to your local-projects.

## Usage example

See packages.lisp, tells you where each function is. Documentation will come around when I have time... hopefully.

## Contact
Just open an issue if you need anything.
